## Setup

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/pvskp/skp-tmux/
$ cd skp-tmux
$ ./stow.sh
```
## "What can I take from this?"
So I spend some time searching a flexible way of configuring tmux. It took me to write a set of bash scripts to wrap tmux native API (see [api.tmux](tmux/api.tmux)). It can be extended to your needs.
